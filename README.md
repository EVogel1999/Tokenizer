# Tokenizer

This is the course project (broken into three parts) for the Programming Languages course 
at Towson University, COSC 455.  This is the first of three parts for the project.  The 
goal is to create a lexical analyzer given a grammar, the grammar and part deliverable can 
be seen in the resources folder of the project.

This uses Java's Regex functionality but can be modified to not use Regex.  To check 
different inputs and their corresponding outputs, either change the input.txt file or
specify a file location with your changes in the Client.java file.
